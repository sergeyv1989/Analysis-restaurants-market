# Restaurants market research

In this project I will perform a market research on the state of restaurants in LA for a group of partners who are interested in opening a restaurant.

The data is compiled from open-source data on restaurants in LA.

The end goal is to attract investors for the new business. Doing so requires to understand the current restaurant market conditions, in particular of successful ones. The results will be used to optimize the decision making for opening a successful establishment, in particular one that may become a chain, and the optimization will in turn assist in attracting investors.

The main steps of the project will be:
- Loading the data.
- Exploring the data to learn its contents and to identify issues with its quality that should be addressed.
- Preparing the data for analysis by treating the discovered issues.
- Analyzing the current restaurant market conditions.
- Summarizing the findings and producing business decisions. In particular, providing recommendations on restaurant type and number of seats, and commenting on the possibility of developing a chain.
- Preparing a presentation of the research results to share with potential investors.
